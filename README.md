Digital Accordions is a series of repositories and best practices in order to compose your educational material or software to receive real-time updates of new versions of knowledge, and rapidly iterate the learning paths of traditional education or edtech students on variables such as strong skills, learning disabilities, labor demand or intellectual curiosity.

According to your requirements, you can choose from a no-code software, a full-featured framework or compose your own solution based on your requirements with available lego pieces.
