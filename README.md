Digital Accordions aims to provide affordable, real-time updates of new knowledge and rapidly iterate traditional or edtech learning paths for students based on variables such as strong skills, learning disabilities, labor demand, and intellectual curiosity. 

Backend services include complete new learning paths or minor updates to educational materials inside the current learning path.

<h2 align=center> 🪗 Aditional Notes </h2>
 
- I deleted the last concept in order to include IA and sharp my backend skills
- I want to create a modular boilerplate for fast deploying to Azure, AWS, GCP  & OpenShift either Serverless or Kubernetes cluster
- You can also choose between Fastapi or NodeJS and choose any database storage
- Config boilertplate file writed in very clear english instructions and you wont need documentation
